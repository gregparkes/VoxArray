	This implementation is an attempt to replicate the Python module 'numpy' which implements
	a float Numpy which can perform matrix and vector-based operations which modify every
	element in the Numpy.

    This is the C++ file, and is ANSI 90 compatible. This can be run using
    C. We also have Numpy.cpp. which are C++ wrapper classes
    around this foundational file.
